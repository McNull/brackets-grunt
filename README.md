brackets-grunt
==============

An extension for Brackets that adds items to the context menu for Gruntfile.js to run tasks or sub-tasks.

# TODO
* Add a Grunt sub-menu to one of the top-level menus. (Debug?)
* Add a quick keyboard shortcut for /grunt default/
* Figure out why only the first line of stdout from grunt-cli is being shown
